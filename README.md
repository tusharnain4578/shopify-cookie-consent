# Shopify App with Theme App Extension

This guide will help you set up your Shopify app with a theme app extension. Follow the steps below to get started.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- Ruby version >= 2.7 installed

## Installation

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

First, you need to install all the required dependencies. Run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 2: Verify Ruby Installation

Ensure you have Ruby version 2.7 or higher installed. You can check your Ruby version by running:

```bash
ruby -v
```

If you need to install or update Ruby, visit the official Ruby [installation guide](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/).

## Step 3: Start the Application

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command will generate a new URL for your app.

### Step 4: Update Theme Extension File

Once the app is started, you need to update the URL in the theme extension file. Open the file 'extensions/cookie-consent-bar/assets/script.js' and change the variable baseApi to the new URL generated in the previous step (which you can find from 'shopify.app.toml' file).

```bash
const baseApi = 'YOUR_NEW_APP_URL';
```

Replace YOUR_NEW_APP_URL with the actual URL generated by npm run dev.
